# Project Purpose: AI-Enabled Patent Writing & Marketplace (Clearinghouse)

## Overview
This application is a Rails-based platform designed to revolutionize the patent ecosystem by leveraging AI to assist in patent drafting and providing a marketplace (clearinghouse) for intellectual property transactions. The project prioritizes pure Rails solutions, utilizing Hotwire, Turbo, and Stimulus for interactive features, avoiding heavy JavaScript frameworks wherever possible.

## Key Objectives
- **AI-Driven Patent Drafting:** Empower users (inventors, attorneys, organizations) to generate high-quality patent drafts with AI assistance, streamlining the invention disclosure and application process.
- **Marketplace/Clearinghouse:** Facilitate the listing, discovery, and transaction of patents and patent applications, enabling a transparent and efficient IP marketplace.
- **User Experience:** Deliver a modern, responsive, and interactive UI using Rails-native technologies (Hotwire, Turbo, Stimulus), ensuring maintainability and performance.

## Core Features
- **Patent Drafting Assistance:**
  - AI-powered tools for claim and specification generation
  - Guided workflows for inventors and attorneys
  - Document management and versioning
- **Marketplace Functionality:**
  - Listing and browsing of patents/patent applications
  - Search, filter, and negotiation tools
  - Secure transaction and escrow mechanisms
- **Collaboration & Workflow:**
  - Real-time editing and commenting (via Turbo/Hotwire)
  - Role-based access control
  - Notifications and activity tracking

## Technology Principles
- **Rails-First:** Favor Rails conventions and built-in solutions over custom JavaScript or third-party front-end frameworks.
- **Hotwire/Turbo/Stimulus:** Use for real-time updates, rich interactivity, and SPA-like experiences without leaving the Rails ecosystem.
- **AI Integration:** Integrate AI services for drafting and analysis, ensuring seamless UX and robust privacy/security.

## Vision
The platform aims to democratize access to high-quality patent drafting and create a vibrant marketplace for intellectual property, reducing friction and inefficiency in the innovation economy.
